# PhysFocus ⚛️
### A "Walled Garden" for Physics Students

**PhysFocus** is a web-based productivity dashboard designed to eliminate the distractions of the open web during intense study sessions. It combines essential tools—a focus timer, a task manager, and a "no-fluff" AI tutor—into a single, responsive interface.

## 💡 The Problem
During my M.Sc. Physics preparation, I noticed two major friction points:
* **Search Engine Rabbit Holes:** Looking up a simple constant often leads to distracting tabs and unrelated content.
* **Chatty AI:** Standard LLMs often provide long-winded explanations when a student only needs a quick formula or a specific value, like the reduced Planck's constant ($\hbar$).

## 🚀 Features
* **Concise AI Tutor:** Powered by **Groq (Llama 3.1)**, designed to provide direct, formula-focused answers without conversational filler.
* **Integrated Pomodoro Timer:** Manage study and break intervals without leaving the application.
* **Dynamic Notes & To-Do:** A central space to track topics and formulas for competitive exams like GATE, JEE, or NEET.
* **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop users using **Tailwind CSS**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Prototyping:** Google AI Studio (Vibe Coding phase)
* **Frontend:** React & Tailwind CSS
* **LLM Orchestration:** Groq Cloud API (Llama-3.1-8b-instant)
* **Deployment:** Vercel

## 👨‍🔬 About the Developer
I am an M.Sc. Physics student at **NIT Hamirpur**. I built this project to bridge the gap between AI capability and practical academic productivity, ensuring that technology serves as a tool for focus rather than a source of distraction.
